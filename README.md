# StarterHacks2018

This app was created by my team and I for StarterHacks 2018 held at the University of Waterloo.

The app allows users to tag locations where there is lots of garbage with the hopes that other users will see that tag and be motivated
to go and clean it up. 

In this app, Googles API's were used for location services as well as pulling up a google maps fragment. 

Over the course of the weekend, my team and I enjoyed learning about fragments, activities, and app development.
